				When something catches my eye, I want to understand how it's made.
				Whether it be a typographic treatment, an animation method or digital application,
				I store the things I'm inspired by to later disect and own the process.
				<br><br>
				This curiosity keeps me constantly developing skill sets that encompass the realm of visual communication.
				Contemporary methods inspire me equally as ancient ones. I observe and possess visual trend while mining the past for the trends root.

				<!-- <br><br>
				I design iteratively. My focus is on creating the simplest complete version, then crafting it into its best possible form.
				I focus on details but keep project completion as a whole in mind.
				<br><br>
				I'm seeking a full time position in which I can collaborate with designers accross all disciplines.
				Drop me a line. -->
